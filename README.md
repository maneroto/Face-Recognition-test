# Face-Recognition-test
This is a face recognition test. It uses python 2.7 and the OpenCV library.
I made this to understand the usage of the OpenCV in python with learning purposes.

All the documentation requiered can be founded in the next link:
https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html

Hope you enjoy the code.
